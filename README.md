*Before changing career paths I studied Contemporary Art History and Theory and work in the NYC art world. I had the pleasure of working alongside some of my favorite emerging artists (at the time), such as Adam Basanta, Ann Hirsch and Jaimie Warren. I then switched gears working in food and customer service as a Shift Manager for a number of Starbucks stores between New York and Colorado. During my time studying art history I discovered the Post-Internet art movement. Many of these artists utilizied code and various programs and frameworks to create their work. This interest has been a huge component of my drive to become a Front End Developer*
